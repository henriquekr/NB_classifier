# NB_classifier
Na√Øve Bayes Classifier for e-commerce websites detection.

<h1> Description </h1>
This script was adapted from a project developped at my current job. A test was done for US websites, whith a little over 1000 URLs and the accuracy was above 85%. The high sucess rate could also be explained by the fact the ecommerce websites share a similar structure, listing categories, indicating prices and so on, making it easier to distinguish them from blogs or news. An interesting development would be to try and categorize the websites by vertical (e.g. fashion, sporting goods and travel). This is my first time playing around with sklearn and any feedback would be welcome!
